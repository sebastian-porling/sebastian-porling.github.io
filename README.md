best product for end.users, owners and other parties.


## :mortar_board: Education 

**Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (KTH), Competer Science and Engineering**

The education focused on software technology, which meant that I could
tailor their expertise in different technologies. I chose to focus more on
user experience and security. I have taken courses where you have been able to use
programming within the different paradigms and working a lot in projects. In addition to this so has
the training been very much about practical problem solving either through the technical courses
or mathematics.

**Bessemerskolan, Upper-Secondary School, Engineering in IT**

In addition to natural sciences such as physics and mathematics, I have learned a lot in
engineering and IT. SI have then learned a lot in product design, CAD and
programming. In the IT specialization, I had to work a lot with Java, web and mobile development.

**Bachelor Thesis**

I conducted a study between different mobile application development tools. To get
develop a good decision-making method so that companies, customers and end-users get the best possible
option. I reviewed popular technologies such as Progressive Web Apps, React Native
and standard applications made with Java or Objective-C. I, together with
another student have developed studies with both end-customers where they have compared an application that
has been developed with these tools to find a difference in the user experience. I have also 
conducted a case study at the IT-consultant company Slagkryssaren AB which meets their requirements for a development tool.
